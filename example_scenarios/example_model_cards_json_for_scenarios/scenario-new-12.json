  "ethicalConsiderations": {
    "biasMitigation": "Rebalanced sampling, per-group performance monitoring, multilingual augmentation, human review for low-confidence predictions ",
    "limitations": "Lower accuracy for rare categories and mixed-symptom narratives; sensitive to short/ambiguous inputs; performance may degrade for languages beyond EN/DA/DE ",
    "misuseCases": "Using outputs as definitive diagnosis, denying care based on predicted category, exporting inputs to third-party tools ",
    "privacyConcerns": "Potential leakage of sensitive content if raw inputs are logged or exported; re-identification risk from free-text ",
